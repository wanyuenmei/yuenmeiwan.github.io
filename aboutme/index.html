			Hi! My name is Yuen Mei, but people call me Mei. Welcome to my website!

		<h1>
			Introduction
		</h1>
		<p>
			I'm curently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration at Berkeley. I was born in Kuala Lumputer, Malaysia. I studied there until I was 15, and then went to an all girls boarding school in Melbourne, Australia. I came to the United States for College and I'm absolutely loving it here. I fell in love with Computer Science at Berkeley and I'm really excited about the possibility of creating something by myself.

		<h1>
			Why CS?
		</h1>
		<p>
			I never actually thought I would end up being a CS major. I've always been passionate about technology but never thought I had the capability of entering the field. I finally gave it a try at Berkeley and after I took Data Structures, I knew this was a career I wanted to pursue.
